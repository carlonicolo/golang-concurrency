# Learning concurrency in Go  

Here you will find the code that i'm using for learning and going deeper about the concurrency in Golang. In particular this repository is referred to the Udemy course [Concurrency in Go (Golang)](https://www.udemy.com/course/concurrency-in-go-golang/) .  

The code is inspired by the projects and lessons that i'm seeing in this course for that reason could be different (my personal comments and modifications).
